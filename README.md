Dependencies
------------

Mizuu uses a number of third-party libraries, which are all included in the lib folder of this repo.

Additionally, you'll need StickyGridHeaders in your workspace, as Mizuu uses it as a reference for the version on the master branch. It has been removed in the dev branch, and won't be required in the future. Here's the link: https://github.com/TonicArtos/StickyGridHeaders
